❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){ return a+b; }
```

🔍 Issues:
*   ❌ The variables `a` and `b` are not defined within the function's scope or passed as arguments. This will lead to errors when the function is executed because JavaScript will look for `a` and `b` in the outer scope (which might not exist) or assume they are global variables.
*   ❌ The function doesn't specify what data types it expects for `a` and `b`, or handle cases where non-numeric values are passed.
*   ❌ There is no explicit handling of potential errors or edge cases, such as when `a` or `b` are not numbers.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
    return "Error: Both arguments must be numbers.";
  }
  return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

*   ✔ The function now accepts `a` and `b` as parameters, making it clear what inputs it requires.
*   ✔ Added input validation to ensure that both `a` and `b` are numbers. If not, it returns an error message.
*   ✔ Explicitly returns an error message when non-numeric arguments are provided, preventing unexpected behavior or crashes.
